# Skylar, "The Help-Mate"

‚ÄúEver felt that you have a lot of questions but there is no one to answer all of them? Introducing Skylar AKA ‚Äúthe helpmate‚Äù. Skylar is a javascript- based project which is primarily based on web automation and web scraping. After executing, Skylar executes a series of web searches and helps the user get the most suitable answers to various questions asked by the user.‚Äù

## Appendix

#### Input from User-ends:
All Skylar requires from a user is a set of questions which he/she wishes to get answers.
#### What is Skylar actually capable of doing? 
1.	Skylar will read all the user‚Äôs queries and look through the internet and try to find the best possible answers and present it to the user.
2.	Skylar will make sure that you get your answers saved so that you can view the solutions in offline mode as well.
3.	Skylar knows the fact that ‚Äúpictures/videos speak more than a thousand words‚Äù so in order to provide the user with a better understanding of the solutions, Skylar will provide video solutions for the problems as well.
4.	Those videos get saved as well because, you know no- one can predict when the internet goes off üëÄ.
5.	Lastly, Skylar understands that there is a probability of not getting an answer on the internet. So, she does the best thing one can do in this situation, i.e., ask for help.
6.	She then asks for the question in a public space, which is twitter in this case so that people all over the globe can try to answer the questions.
